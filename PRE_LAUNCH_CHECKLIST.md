## ‚ùå CRITICAL: Not Ready for Public Launch Yet

Your website is **NOT ready** for public use. Here's what needs to be fixed first:

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL Issues (MUST fix before launch)

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Database Not Configured
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT DONE
- **Problem**: Still using SQLite (local files) instead of Supabase
- **Risk**: Will crash and lose data with real traffic
- **Action Required**: 
  1. Follow `QUICK_START.md` to set up Supabase
  2. This takes 10 minutes and is ESSENTIAL
  3. Without this, your database will fail under load

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è API Routes Not Using Supabase
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT DONE
- **Problem**: All API routes still importing from `lib/database` (SQLite)
- **File**: `app/api/admin/appointments/route.ts` line 1
- **Action Required**: Update all API routes to use the unified database manager

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing Email Notifications
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Problem**: Customers don't receive booking confirmations
- **Risk**: High no-show rate, poor customer experience
- **Action Required**: 
  1. Set up email service (SendGrid, Resend, etc.)
  2. Send confirmation emails when appointments are booked

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Booking Conflicts Not Prevented
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Problem**: Multiple people can book same time slot
- **Risk**: Overbooking, chaos, lost revenue
- **Action Required**: Add time slot validation and locking

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è No Backup/Recovery System
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT DONE
- **Problem**: If server crashes, data could be lost
- **Action Required**: Set up automated backups in Supabase

---

## üü° Important Issues (Should fix before launch)

### 6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Admin Login Missing
**Status**: ‚ùì NEEDS VERIFICATION
- **Problem**: Admin portal may not be properly secured
- **Action Required**: Test admin login flow completely

### 7. ‚ö†Ô∏è No Error Handling on Frontend
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL
- **Problem**: Booking failures are hidden from users
- **File**: `app/booking/page.tsx` shows "success" even when booking fails
- **Action Required**: Show proper error messages to users

### 8. ‚ö†Ô∏è No Rate Limiting on Booking Form
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Problem**: Can spam bookings or get attacked
- **Action Required**: Add rate limiting to booking endpoint

### 9. ‚ö†Ô∏è Environment Variables Not Set
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT DONE
- **Problem**: `.env.local` not configured for production
- **Action Required**: Set all environment variables

### 10. ‚ö†Ô∏è No SSL/HTTPS Certificate
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPENDS ON HOSTING
- **Problem**: Data not encrypted in transit
- **Action Required**: Deploy on Vercel/Netlify (HTTPS automatic)

## üü¢ Content Issues (Nice to have)

### 11. ‚ö†Ô∏è Placeholder Contact Info
**Status**: ‚ùå STILL HAS PLACEHOLDERS

  - Address: "123 Beauty St" (should be real address)
  - Phone: "(555) 123-1234" (should be real phone)
  - Email: "hello@fifihair.com" (should be real email)

### 12. ‚ö†Ô∏è Gallery Images

- **Action Required**: Replace stock images with your actual work
