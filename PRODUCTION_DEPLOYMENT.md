# Production Deployment Guide
## Fifi Hair Salon - Professional Grade Setup

### Current Capacity Analysis

**Current Setup:**
- SQLite database (local file-based)
- Better-sqlite3 package
- WAL mode enabled for concurrency

**Capacity Issue:**
- ⚠️ **SQLite is NOT suitable for production at scale**
- Cannot handle 40 appointments/day × 365 days = 14,600 appointments/year
- Single file database - no redundancy
- No automated backups
- Limited concurrent access
- Server restart = data loss risk if not properly managed

### Recommended Production Architecture

#### Option 1: Vercel + Supabase (Recommended for quick setup)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase (free tier: 500MB, paid: scales infinitely)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (free tier available)
- **Backups**: Automatic daily backups with Supabase
- **Scalability**: Can handle millions of appointments
- **Cost**: ~$10-25/month

#### Option 2: AWS Architecture (Enterprise grade)
- **Database**: Amazon RDS PostgreSQL
- **Hosting**: AWS Amplify or EC2
- **Backups**: Automated daily snapshots + point-in-time recovery
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling to handle unlimited load
- **Cost**: ~$50-200/month

#### Option 3: Google Cloud Platform (Reliable & cost-effective)
- **Database**: Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL
- **Hosting**: Cloud Run or App Engine
- **Backups**: Automated daily backups
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling
- **Cost**: ~$30-100/month

### Critical Requirements for 14,600+ Appointments/Year

1. **Database Migration Required** ⚠️
   - Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL or MySQL
   - Update connection strings
   - Test migration scripts

2. **Automated Backups**
   - Daily automated database backups
   - Minimum 7-day retention
   - Test restore procedures

3. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Database health monitoring
   - Error tracking (Sentry, Rollbar)
   - Performance monitoring
   - Uptime monitoring

4. **Security**
   - SSL/TLS encryption
   - SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
   - Input validation (already in place ✓)
   - Rate limiting on booking form

5. **Redundancy**
   - Multiple server instances
   - Load balancing
   - Database replication (read replicas)

### Immediate Action Items

#### Before Going Live:
1. ✅ Database migration to PostgreSQL
2. ✅ Set up automated backups
3. ✅ Configure monitoring and alerts
4. ✅ Load testing (simulate 40 concurrent bookings)
5. ✅ Security audit
6. ✅ Backup restoration test
7. ✅ Email notifications for bookings
8. ✅ Admin authentication (already in place ✓)

### Estimated Timeline & Cost

**Quick Setup (Option 1 - Supabase):**
- Time: 4-8 hours
- Cost: $0-25/month
- Setup Difficulty: Easy

**Enterprise Setup (Option 2 - AWS):**
- Time: 2-3 days
- Cost: $50-200/month
- Setup Difficulty: Advanced

### Migration Script Needed

We need to create a migration script to:
1. Export all data from SQLite
2. Transform to PostgreSQL format
3. Import to production database
4. Verify data integrity

### Next Steps

1. **Choose deployment option** (I recommend Supabase for quick setup)
2. **I can help set up the database migration**
3. **Configure backups and monitoring**
4. **Run load tests before launch**

### Contact

Would you like me to:
- Set up the Supabase database and migration?
- Create the deployment configuration?
- Implement backup and monitoring?

**Bottom Line:** Your current SQLite setup will NOT handle production traffic. We need to migrate to a proper database before launch.
